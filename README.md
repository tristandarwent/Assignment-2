###Technologies

I used Node.js as my server because it allows me to accomplish my goal of users being able to interact with each other in real time.

I used Gulp as my preprocessor along with Jade and Sass as it compiled my code easily in the background. Jade and Sass made writing HTML and CSS much faster and easier.
